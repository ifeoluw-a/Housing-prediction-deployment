## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build and deploy a housing price prediction model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, providing a comprehensive solution for predicting house prices.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Normalization and scaling of features

- **Regression Model:** 
  - Implementation of various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

- **Model Evaluation:** 
  - Evaluation metrics including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- **Deployment:** 
  - A user-friendly web application for real-time predictions using Streamlit

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Streamlit (for deployment)

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model includes various features relevant to real estate pricing. Key attributes include:

- **Location**: Geographic location of the property
- **Square Footage**: Total area of the house
- **Number of Rooms**: Total number of rooms in the house
- **Year Built**: The year the house was constructed
- **Amenities**: Features such as garage, pool, etc.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ifeoluw-a/housing-price-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd housing-price-prediction
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Indicates how well the features explain the variability in the target variable.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Represents the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.

## Deployment
The project is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input housing features and receive estimated prices in real-time. Follow the instructions in the How to Use section to access the deployed application.
